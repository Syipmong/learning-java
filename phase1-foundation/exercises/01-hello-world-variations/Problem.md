# Exercise 1: Hello World Variations

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Learn basic Java syntax, output operations, and variable usage through variations of the classic "Hello World" program.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### Part A: Basic Hello World
1. Create a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
2. Add your name to make it personal: "Hello, World! My name is [YourName]"

### Part B: Variables and Data Types
1. Create variables for:
   - Your name (String)
   - Your age (int)
   - Your height in meters (double)
   - Whether you like programming (boolean)
2. Print these variables in a formatted message

### Part C: User Input
1. Modify the program to ask for user input
2. Read the user's name and age
3. Display a personalized greeting

### Part D: Calculations
1. Ask for the user's birth year
2. Calculate their age based on the current year (2025)
3. Display the calculated age

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- Use proper Java naming conventions
- Include appropriate comments
- Handle basic input/output operations
- Use Scanner class for user input

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output
```
=== Hello World Variations ===

Part A: Basic Greeting
Hello, World! My name is John Doe

Part B: Personal Information
Name: John Doe
Age: 25 years old
Height: 1.75 meters
Likes programming: true

Part C: Interactive Greeting
What's your name? Alice
How old are you? 30
Hello Alice! Nice to meet you. You are 30 years old.

Part D: Age Calculator
What year were you born? 1995
Based on 2025, you are approximately 30 years old.
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases
Your program should handle:
1. Different name inputs (including spaces)
2. Various age values (positive integers)
3. Different birth years (reasonable range)
4. Decimal height values

## ðŸ’¡ Hints
- Use `System.out.println()` for output
- Use `Scanner` class for input
- Remember to import `java.util.Scanner`
- Use `nextLine()` for strings and `nextInt()` for integers
- Be careful with Scanner methods and newline characters

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Goals
After completing this exercise, you should understand:
- Basic Java program structure
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Primitive data types (int, double, boolean)
- String data type
- Basic input/output operations
- Simple arithmetic operations
- String concatenation
