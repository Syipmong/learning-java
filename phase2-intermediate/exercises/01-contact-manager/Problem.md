# Exercise 1: Contact Manager System

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a comprehensive contact management system that demonstrates the effective use of Java Collections Framework, including ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and various collection operations.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### Part A: Contact Class Design
Create a `Contact` class with:
1. Properties: name, phone, email, address, tags
2. Proper encapsulation with getters and setters
3. Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods
4. Implement `Comparable` interface for natural ordering
5. Override `toString()` method for display

### Part B: ContactManager Implementation
Create a `ContactManager` class using different collections:
1. **ArrayList** - Store all contacts in insertion order
2. **HashMap** - Quick lookup by phone number
3. **TreeSet** - Maintain contacts in sorted order by name
4. **HashSet** - Store unique email addresses to prevent duplicates

### Part C: Core Operations
Implement the following methods:
1. `addContact(Contact contact)` - Add new contact with validation
2. `removeContact(String phone)` - Remove contact by phone number
3. `updateContact(String phone, Contact newContact)` - Update existing contact
4. `findByPhone(String phone)` - Find contact by phone number
5. `findByName(String name)` - Find contacts by name (partial match)
6. `findByEmail(String email)` - Find contact by email address

### Part D: Advanced Features
1. **Search Operations**:
   - Find contacts by tag
   - Search contacts containing specific keywords
   - Get contacts within a specific city/area

2. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Import contacts from CSV format
   - Export contacts to different formats
   - Merge duplicate contacts

3. **Statistics**:
   - Total number of contacts
   - Most common email domains
   - Contacts grouped by tags

### Part E: Collection Performance Analysis
1. Compare performance of different search methods
2. Analyze memory usage of different collection types
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed contacts

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- Use appropriate collection types for each operation
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use generics for type safety
- Follow object-oriented design principles
- Include comprehensive input validation

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output
```

9. Display Statistics
10. Import/Export
0. Exit

Choose an option: 1

Enter contact details:
Name: John Doe
Phone: +1-555-123-4567
Email: john.doe@email.com
Address: 123 Main St, New York, NY
Tags (comma-separated): work, client, important

Choose an option: 8

=== All Contacts (Sorted by Name) ===
1. Alice Smith
   Phone: +1-555-987-6543
   Email: alice.smith@email.com
   Address: 456 Oak Ave, Boston, MA
   Tags: [friend, college]

2. John Doe
   Phone: +1-555-123-4567
   Email: john.doe@email.com
   Address: 123 Main St, New York, NY
   Tags: [work, client, important]

Total Contacts: 2
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases
Your implementation should handle:
1. **Valid Operations**:
   - Adding contacts with all required fields
   - Searching by various criteria
   - Updating existing contacts

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Duplicate phone numbers (should prevent)
   - Duplicate email addresses (should warn)
   - Empty or null input values
   - Special characters in names/addresses

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Adding 1000+ contacts
   - Searching in large datasets
   - Memory usage with different collection sizes

## ðŸ’¡ Hints
- Use `HashMap<String, Contact>` for O(1) phone number lookups
- Use `TreeSet<Contact>` for automatic sorting by name
- Use `HashSet<String>` to track unique email addresses
- Implement `Comparator` for different sorting options
- Use `Iterator` for safe collection traversal and modification
- Consider using `LinkedHashMap` to preserve insertion order
- Use `Collections.unmodifiableList()` for read-only views

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Goals
After completing this exercise, you should understand:
- When to use different collection types (List, Set, Map)
- Performance characteristics of different collections
- Proper implementation of `equals()` and `hashCode()`
- Using `Comparable` and `Comparator` for sorting
- Iterator pattern for safe collection modification
- Generic type parameters and wildcards
- Collection utility methods and operations
